Updates for data.sql - Spring Boot 2.5.0 or Greater
Summary
If you are using Spring Boot 2.5.0 or Greater, you have two options

1) Use schema.sql instead of data.sql  OR

2) Continue using data.sql. Add the following property to application.properties

spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true



Why do you need to make the change?

By default, data.sql scripts are now run before Hibernate is initialized. This aligns the behaviour of basic script-based initialization 
with that of Flyway and Liquibase. If you want to use data.sql to populate a schema created by Hibernate, set spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization to true.
 While mixing database initialization technologies is not recommended, this will also allow you to use a schema.sql script to build upon a 
 Hibernate-created schema before itâ€™s populated via data.sql.
